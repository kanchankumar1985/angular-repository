Tume Hue Meherban
   To Badla Hai Sama
Bekhumari ka nasha bekarari ka nasha

(this whole surrounding,environment and Ambience has changed when you became Gracious to me. Now i started feeling Intoxicated and getting feeling of ecstasy and seperation).

Is Jahan se us flak tak tu hi tu hai tu hi tu hai
Roop tera khushnuma hai
Mere sine me basa hai

(you only are pervading all over the creation and beyond it.
Your Beauty is very pleasant which is embedded in my Heart )

Meri Raatein Meri Aaanhein Dhoonti hai Wo niganhein
Teri annkho me jo nasha hai Mere Nas Nas me Chadha hai

(All my Nights and Ah are searching you mesmerizing beautiful eye. The Intoxications of those eyes are filled in my veins)


Tume Hue Meherban
